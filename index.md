# Welcome to the BlackArch Linux Wiki

## What is BlackArch Linux

[BlackArch](https://blackarch.org) is a complete Linux distribution for penetration testers and security researchers.
It is derived from [ArchLinux](https://www.archlinux.org) and users can install BlackArch components
individually or in groups directly on top of it.

The toolset is distributed as an Arch Linux [unoffical user repository](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Unofficial\_User\_Repositories) so you can install BlackArch on top of
an existing Arch Linux installation. Packages may be installed individually or by category.

The constantly expanding repository currently includes over [2900](https://blackarch.org/tools.html) tools.
All tools are thoroughly tested before being added to the codebase to maintain the quality of the repository.

## Goal of this Wiki

The goal of this wiki is to provide information and documentation for the users of BlackArch. As the distribution is under active development, this wiki is in a constant state of "work in progress".
