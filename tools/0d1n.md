# 0d1n

## Description
0d1n is a powerful tool designed to automate customized attacks against web applications. Its advanced thread pool and C language implementation allows for significantly faster execution of attacks.

## Groups

- blackarch
- blackarch-webapp
- blackarch-fuzzer
- blackarch-scanner

## Tool functions

- Brute force login and passwords in auth forms
- Directory disclosure ( use PATH list to the brute, and find HTTP status code )
- Test to find SQL Injection and XSS vulnerabilities
- Test to find SSRF
- Test to find Command injection
- Options to load ANTI-CSRF token each request
- Options to use random proxy per request
- Options to use random useragent per request
- Option for keep alive test (slowloris test)
- other functions.

## Installation
Instructions on how to install the tool or package on BlackArch Linux.

```
pacman -S 0d1n
```

## Attack examples
### Brute force to find the directory:
```
0d1n --host http://127.0.0.1/^ --payloads /opt/0d1n/payloads/dir_brute.txt --threads 500 --timeout 3 --log bartsimpsom4 --save_response
```
**Note: You can change the value of threads. If you have a good machine, you can try 800, 1200 each device has a different context.**

### For SQL injection attack:
```
0d1n --host 'http://site.com/view/1^/product/^/' --payloads /opt/0d1n/payloads/sqli_list.txt --find_string_list /opt/0d1n/payloads/sqli_str2find_list.txt --log log1337 --tamper randcase --threads 800 --timeout 3 --save_response\n"
```
**Note: Tamper is a resource to try to bypass the web application firewall**

### To brute force auth system:
```
0d1n --host 'http://site.com/auth.py' --post 'user=admin&password=^' --payloads /opt/0d1n/payloads/wordlist.txt --log log007 --threads 500 --timeout 3\n"
```
**Note: if you have a csrf token, you can use argv to get this token for each request and brute.**

### Search SQLi in hard mode in login system with csrf token:
```
0d1n  --host "http://127.0.0.1/vulnerabilities/sqli/index.php?id=^" --payloads /opt/0d1n/payloads/sqli.txt --find_string_list /opt/0d1n/payloads/find_responses.txt --token_name user_token --log logtest_fibonaci49 --cookie_jar /home/user_name/cookies.txt --save_response --tamper randcase --threads 100
```
**Note: Load the cookies jar from the browser and save in cookies.txt to load.**

## Additional Resources
### External Libs
- To gain extreme performance, 0d1n uses a thread pool of POSIX threads. You can study this small [library](https://github.com/Pithikos/C-Thread-Pool).
- 0d1n uses OpenBSD/NetBSD functions to work with strings something like `strlcat()` and `strlcpy()` to prevent buffer overflow. More info [here](https://man.openbsd.org/strlcpy.3).
- Developer demonstration [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1L22mbbVge0).
