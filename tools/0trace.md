# 0trace

## Description
0trace is a python port of [Michal Zalewskiâ€™s](http://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/) 0trace hop enumeration tool. A security reconnaissance / firewall bypassing tool. This tool enables the user to perform hop enumeration ("traceroute") within an established TCP connection, such as an HTTP or SMTP session. This is opposed to sending stray packets, as traceroute-type tools usually do. 

The important benefit of using an established connection and matching TCP packets to send a TTL-based probe is that such traffic is happily allowed through by many stateful firewalls and other defenses without further inspection (since it is related to an entry in the connection table).
